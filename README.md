## 📚 About the Program

With the explosion of data across science, economics, administration, medicine, and many other fields, the demand for data science skills is rapidly increasing. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, ethics, and domain-specific knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from data.

The **CAS in Applied Data Science** at the University of Bern is a **21-day program** (August–January) designed for professionals and researchers in both the private and public sectors. The curriculum covers the full data science cycle:

- **Data acquisition & planning**
- **Data description & visualization**
- **Statistical inference**
- **Machine learning**
- **Best practices & ethics**
- **Deep learning**

The program is **applied and peer-oriented**, focusing on practical usage of common data science tools and infrastructures, rather than theoretical elaboration.
