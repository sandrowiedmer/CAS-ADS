# Module 6: Deep Learning

**Mastering deep learning with TensorFlow in the inspiring setting of Mürren, Bernese Oberland.**

---

## 📚 Overview

In this module, you will:
- Learn to **design, train, and evaluate deep learning models** using TensorFlow
- Explore **neural network architectures** for various tasks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.)
- Gain hands-on experience with **real-world datasets and applications**
- Understand best practices for **optimization, regularization, and deployment**

**🏔️ Location Note:**
This module traditionally takes place at the historic [Hotel Regina](https://www.hotel-regina.ch/) in the picturesque ski resort of Mürren (Bernese Oberland), just about two train hours from Bern. Full pension hotel accommodation is included in the CAS fee.
